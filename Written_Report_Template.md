# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the Kickstarter Challenge analysis using excel is to gather useful information to make the best decision. The process of two deliverable 1 and 2 uses analytical and logical reasoning to obtain visualization chart to gain information from the data. It can help Louise to get the better idea of fundraising goal in a short amount of time. 


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Kickstarter outcomes analysis based on launch date the month and the highest successful rate for the project. It consist of successful, failed, and canceled in each month to achieve the expected outcomes for Louise to make the clear decision. In this analysis outcome, pivot charts create visualizations line graph provide the data information for Louise's fundraising goal.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Kickstarter analysis of outcomes based on goals line graph shown the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. The lowest goal has 75.81%, the highest successful rate whereas the highest goal has the lowest successful rate 12.5%.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Having excel function error is the most challenging part in the outcomes based on goals project. Countifs syntax function must be challenging without knowing criteria to cells across multiple ranges and counts the number of criteria are met. Practice multiple times make the analysis process easy to understand. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

In the Outcomes Based on Launch Date line chart, I created pivot table to filter parent category, outcomes in value and month in roll. In the line chart, months in the x-axis, and outcomes in the y-axis.Upon visual inspection of line chart, we can see the most successful month is in May where the highest successful point at 111, failed at 52, and canceled at 3. We can filter parent category to generate different outcomes with line chart based on the category.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

In the Outcomes Based on Goals, calculate percentage on successful rate, failed, and canceled to create the line graph. In the line graph, percentage in the y-axis, and the goal range in x-axis. It shown the lowest goal can produce the highest successful rate. Upon visual inspection of line chart, we will set 6 goals based on the goal range; less than 1000, 1000 to 4999, 5000 to 9999, 10000 to 14999, 35000 to 39999, and 40000 to 44999. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

One of the limitations that came across where outcomes based on goal analysis not including the country where all the goals are most successful.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We can create column chart for Theater Outcomes by Launch Date to compare successful, failed, and canceled side by side. It can easy to visualize which month has the highest successful number. Moreover, we can also create pie chart for the Outcomes Based on Goals to illustrate the percentage in pie chart with different color to identify the range of goal.
